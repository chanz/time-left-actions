// 
// Note: sound files are downloaded and precached by default when used here.
// 
// Usage:
// type 	- Set event type. 0 = none/off; 1 = map time left; 2 = round time left; 4 = bomb time left.
//		  Sum them up to use the same action for more events. Ex: 6 = 2 + 4, means round and bomb time left.
//		  NOTE: In round based games (like Counter-Strike:Source), when 'type' contains 1 (map time left) then,
//		  the given sounds in 'sound' of an action won't be played if, both teams has players, since the round or the bomb 
//		  ends the round/game and not the time limit on the map (This prevents a count down that has no visible effect when reached 0).
//
// time 	- How many seconds before the given event ends, the action will be triggered.
//
// - The following variables can contain tokens, that are replaced upon execution of the action.
//   A list of tokens can be found in the first post of the plugin thead (http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=843377).
//
// sound	- The path to the sound you want to play (this sound has to be in '<moddir>/sound'), 
//		  if left empty no sound will be played.
//		  NOTE: You can seperate sounds and adjustments with ;
//		  Ex: "timeleft/bell.wav;timeleft/en/fvox/one.wav", this will play the bell.wav and then the one.wav
//		  Ex: "timeleft/bell.wav;-0.5;timeleft/en/fvox/one.wav", this will play the ball.wav and the one.wav, but the one.wav is played -0.5 seconds sooner than in the first example.
//
// cmd		- The command that will be executed in the server console if left empty nothing will be executed.
//
// chat	- The message that will be send to all players, you can use color codes.
//		  (color codes can be found at http://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=1398702&postcount=2).
